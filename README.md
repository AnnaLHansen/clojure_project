Introduction to Clojure 

Suggested programs for Clojure:
Visual studio Code. With the extention 'Calva' for REPL. 
(Java and Leiningen needs to be installed).

Visual studio Code can be used to write and manage files. It can also pull and push files to a github repository.
Nightcode can be used to run the code line-by-line.

Clojure is good at data processing with several built-in ways to represent data that are easy to use and powerful. 

Clojure is known for its concurrency.

Parenthesis in Clojure are important.
Parenthesis in Clojure enclose instructions. A left parathensis is the start of the instruction, and the right parenthesis is the end of the instruction. Nested parenthesis are normal in Clojure. 

The instructions inside the parenthesis are functions. 
The first element inside a parenthesis is the function, and the rest of the elements inside a parenthesis are inputs to that function.
